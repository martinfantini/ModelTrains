## Expander

Here is the expander connected to the central, to have more input/output configuation.

## Control Program

For control all the model trains mock-up, I use the [Rocrail](https://wiki.rocrail.net/doku.php?id=start). Because
I do have the shema of the mock-up already dome.

for the future, I can test it on [JMRI](https://www.jmri.org/), because it seems more programaticlly.

## Signal

This is the DCC circuic, which sniffers the DCC signaliing and generate changes for the signals in the mock-up.
