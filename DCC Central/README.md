# DCC Central

As a DCC central, I use the open source project [CommandStation-EX](https://github.com/DCC-EX/CommandStation-EX), here is added as asubmodule up this project.
Usigin Arduino ATMega 328, I generate a booster with the use of the motor diver [BTS7960](./'BTS7960 Motor Driver.pdf')

## CommandStation-EX

Here is the CommandStation-EX project used to generate the DCC central, which will be user to control all the trains and diferent periferics asociated to the DCC protocol.

## Booster

In this folder contains the source code to coltrol the booster with the ATMega 328.

## Booster-Shield

In this folder contains the circuit board to control the [motor driver](./'BTS7960 Motor Driver.pdf')
